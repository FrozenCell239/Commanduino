# Commanduino
An example of a simple way to command an Arduino relay via a PHP web page (was useful for my student project).

In this example the PHP webpage was hosted on a Debian 11 server and was runned by a classical Apache 2 service, and the Arduino board and the physical server are connected with a USB cable.
I'm looking for a way to make this work but with an Ethernet connection instead of the USB cable. So it could be used in an actual firm network as I have to do in my student project.
